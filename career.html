                <h2>City of Duluth — Human Resources</h2>
                <p class="meta">411 West 1st Street, Duluth, Minnesota 55802</p>
                <p class="meta"><a href="https://duluthmn.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://duluthmn.gov/</a></p>
                <p>I am interested in pursuing opportunities within municipal human resources because I appreciate how local government positions support communities directly. During my internship in an HR department last summer I gained hands-on experience with administrative HR processes, applicant tracking basics, and stakeholder communication. That experience helped me discover that municipal HR work—balancing policy, recruitment, and public service—fits both my skills and my values.</p>
                <p>In municipal HR I am particularly drawn to recruitment and onboarding, employee relations, and projects that improve hiring equity and access. I bring strong organizational skills, attention to confidentiality, and a collaborative mindset. I’m eager to grow my knowledge of HR policy, labor relations, and local government hiring practices.</p>

                <h2>Essentia Health — HR Recruitment</h2>
                <p class="meta">407 E 3rd St, Duluth, MN 55805</p>
                <p class="meta"><a href="https://www.essentiacareers.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.essentiacareers.org/</a></p>
                <p>My experiences as a long-term patient at Essentia Health (cardiogram scans, MRIs, x-rays, and an ACL reconstruction) have given me a unique perspective on the healthcare system and how HR supports patient-centered staff. I’m interested in HR recruitment roles in healthcare because they combine operational recruiting work with supporting a mission-driven workforce.</p>
                <p>I believe my time interacting with clinical teams, combined with my HR internship background, positions me to contribute to talent attraction efforts and candidate experience improvements. In healthcare recruitment I would focus on clear communication, respectful candidate care, and matching applicants to roles where they can thrive while supporting patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Why HR fits my strengths</h2>
                <p>I’m drawn to human resources because it blends interpersonal communication, detailed organization, and strategic thinking. Important strengths I bring include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Practical HR experience from an internship: administrative HR tasks, scheduling, basic applicant tracking, and candidate outreach.</li>
                    <li>Strong written and verbal communication; I write clearly and follow up promptly with applicants and teams.</li>
                    <li>Confidentiality and professionalism: experience handling sensitive information responsibly.</li>
                    <li>Leadership and service: experience coaching tennis and participating in campus leadership programs taught me how to mentor, coordinate, and motivate others.</li>
                    <li>Adaptability and learning mindset: I pick up new software and procedures quickly and welcome constructive feedback.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Academically, I’m building skills that support HR work—organization, ethics, and teamwork—and I’m excited to apply classroom learning to real HR projects. I’m comfortable working in fast-paced environments and collaborating with cross-functional teams.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>How I can contribute</h2>
                <p>I can immediately assist with recruitment operations: posting openings, coordinating interviews, managing candidate communications, and performing outreach to local student and professional networks. Over time, I aim to support continuous improvement initiatives such as streamlining onboarding, improving candidate experience, and supporting diversity and inclusion efforts in hiring.</p>
                <p>If you are an employer or recruiter reading this page, I welcome opportunities to connect. I can provide a resume, references, and examples of HR-related work from my internship.</p>
